When you obtain a new item, you need to update this mental map to determine the best possibilities, optimize your path, and decide where to go next to maximize the chances to exit quickly.\n\nThe ability to follow an efficient path is important during races, in which all the competing players will have the same game configuration and must exit the house as fast as they can.
